## Creating Sound Board

1. Create new repository on your Github, based on this repository.
   - Make sure your repository is **public** and its name starts with `soundboardio-`
   - Prepare your **sounds** (Github or self-hosted files)
   - Create your **[`soundboardio.json`](https://github.com/soundboardio/soundboardio-mydlil-barana/blob/master/soundboardio.json) manifest**. Be creative. Choose name, description, colors and tiles, ...
   - Prepare **icons** (you will need at least two icons if you want your app to be installable). [See this example](https://github.com/soundboardio/soundboardio-mydlil-barana/blob/master/soundboardio.json#L13)
2. Now you can just open your shiny new app with your own url. It's working automagically.

> If your repository is called https://github.com/ `aquasoup/soundboardio-mydlil-barana` your SoundBoardio url will be https://soundboardio.com/ `app/aquasoup/mydlil-barana`
